# facebook_to_vcard
I lost all my contacts, and since Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, you can download a zip file containing all the informations facebook has about you ... 

Including <strong>your</strong> contacts ! 

Here is a simple parser to translate the HTML file to the vCard format 

### Usage:
It's easy as hell :
- python3 facebook_to_vcard.py -i < HTML input file > -o < vCard file location >
